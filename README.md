# Citadel Europe Terminal Spring 2025: git blame --team  
**üèÜ 11th Place (Out of 30 Teams) | Python Algorithm | Tower Defense AI Competition**  

## Overview  
Our team (*git blame --team*) competed in **The Citadel Europe Terminal Spring 2025**, a week-long algorithmic AI competition where students from top European institutions developed tower defense-style strategies in Python. Teams battled in round-robin tournaments and against Correlation One-designed boss AIs, earning raffle entries for victories.  

**Result:** **11th out of 30 teams** with our custom Python algorithm `test-algo`.

## Team  
- **Members:** Carys, Fahim, Ewan (students from top UK universities)  
- **Skills:** AI, algorithms, Python optimization, competitive programming  

## Technical Details  
### Algorithm: `test-algo`  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Adaptive tower placement & resource allocation  
  - Adaptive opening strategy
  - Efficient unit targeting logic  
- **Limitations & Challenges:**  
  - Limited diversity in attacking units used
  - Handling unpredictable boss AI patterns  

### Competition Structure  
- **Round-robin tournament** (head-to-head matches)  
- **Boss battles** (special AI opponents by Correlation One)  
- **Scoring:** Wins contributed to rankings + raffle entries  

## Lessons & Improvements  
**What Worked:**  
- Strong early-game strategy 
- Adaptive code for reacting to opponent's strategy

**Future Optimizations:**  
- Experiment with reinforcement learning for adaptive play  
- Switch to a faster language (e.g., C++) for critical sections
